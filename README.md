# Waterdeep Dragon Heist
This repo forked from [Drunken Economist's](https://github.com/drunken-economist/waterdeep_dragon_heist) so I could correct some PDF/Homebrewey printing errors - and then I kept going a little.
Don't know yet if there will be much else here beyond the Enchiridion, we'll see.

## Contents
* This repo contains the Mozilla Public License 2.0 file and this readme

* The [source text](enchiridion-homebrewery.md) to create a PDF at [Homebrewey](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com).

* You can also just [download the PDF from Homebrewery here](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/LF7lOAj3z).

* Or if you're having trouble with Homebrewery etc etc, you can just [download the PDF in this repo](Volos-Waterdeep-Enchiridion-small.pdf). Please note some 1-column wide images were shrunk to fit under GitHub's 25mb filesize limit. I have not tested printing it, hopefully the difference is not noticeable. This file was created with the [enchiridion-homebrewery-small.md file](enchiridion-homebrewery-small.md), but just use [the default file](enchiridion-homebrewery.md) - the resulting file is only 2mb larger.

* If you have impaired vision, or just want re-sizable text, there is also the [enchiridion-github.md file](enchiridion-github.md) which can be viewed on Github and has a mix of markdown and HTML.

* And then I also just converted that into an [HTML version](enchiridion.html)

* [enchiridion.md](enchiridion.md) is the fully markdown compliant version

* All images are [saved locally in the assets-enchiridion directory](assets-enchiridion) to avoid any future broken links etc.
